----THE DOCK----
There is always at least one ship docked.

Ways the ship can chance:
 - Get shipwrecked -> Becomes the default hull again
 - Beat the game with a ship -> Becomes that ship
 - Purchase a hull from the ship yard -> Becomes that ship
 
You can select a hull from any hull that you have purchased or brought back and haven't wrecked.

You can only purchase ships that the shop has blueprints for:
 - They have a number of default blueprints to start
 - Discover blueprints while sailing
 - Automatically unlock the blueprint for any ship you bring back to port


----THE TOWN----

Various parts of the town can slowly be expanded over time:
 - Find new blueprints for the shipyard [affects sailing gameplay]
 - Expand the aviary with new bird companions [slightly affects all gameplay]
 - Unlock new outfits to wear at the tailor [affects exploration gameplay]
 - Research new weaponry to equip [affects exploration gameplay]
