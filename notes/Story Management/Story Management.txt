Stories are going to end up being incredibly complex actions that manage everything from time of day to
mob spawns, to environment changes and events. This can also be changed entirely by the game mode being
set to either Default or Infinite.

A default day has a set track of times, events, and ends within a finite amount of time.
Infinite mode loops the day cycle and randomly starts events.

Here is a list of everything a story needs to be able to manage:
	* Time of day (Set / progresses and loops)
	- Mob variety
	* Max danger level (Set / constantly increasing)
	* Events / weather (Set / random)
	- Ground spawning in and out / changing depth
	* Bosses triggering (End of level / every few days, increasing in difficulty)
	* Item availability (Set / decreases in frequency over time)
	- Background elements
	- Islands
	- Environment changes
	- Color palette
	- Palette transitions
	- Obstacles
	- Music
	
* These items behave differently for default /vs/ infinite
