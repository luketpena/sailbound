--< HOW IT WORKS >--
To avoid the performance issues of writing individual letters via text (while wanting to retain per-character
effects), I have mapped the text to a ds map. This is done in scr_alphabet_map.

Because of this, all text written must be written in lowercase. This is what is used to map it, capital
letters are reserved for some special characters.

--< EFFECTS >--
Effects are injected into the text before the text you want to be affected.

Example: "if i want this to [color,255,0,0] [quakeLow] shake [quakeOff] then i might do something like this.".
	- Effects must be surrounded by brackets
	- There must be spaces between each effect call and line of text
	- Multiple effects can be called in a row
	- If an effect has arguments, these are provided via commas after the name of the effect
	
Available effects:
	- [color,r,g,b] Sets the color of dialog to follow via rgb values.
	- [defaultColor] Returns the text to the default color (as defined earlier in dialog_display)
	- [quakeLow] Shakes the text a little bit
	- [quakeHigh] Shakes the text a lot
	- [quakeOff] Turns off shaking
	- [waveSet,strength,speed,offset] Starts a wave:
		- Strength: how high up and down it moves
		- Speed: how quickly the sine wave occilates
		- Offset: how much each individual character is offset on the sine value from the previous value
	- [waveOn] Turns the wave on (using existing values)
	- [waveOff] Turns the wave off
	- [scale,size,rate] Sets the start scale and how quickly it should reduce to normal
	
Future presets I would like:
	- [sing] Scales mildly (like 1.2) and waves
	- [shout] Scales from 2 or larger quickly down to 0
	- [whisper] Scales up from 0 slowly
	- [c_white, c_black, etc] Set color by color preset values

Future effects:
	- [wobble] Characters rotate back and forth on a wave
