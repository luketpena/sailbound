---< New Ship Data Pipeline >---
1. Import sprites (hull, sail, ship orb, other)
2. If the hull needs a custom draw object, make a draw object child of o_boatDraw_default
3. Define hull stats in scr_hull_stats
4. Define boat catalogue data in the shipDataCatalogue
	- Name
	- Description
	- Ship orb sprite
	- Boat draw object (default if needed)
	- hullStats script


Note: the catalogue keys act as the source of truth for these values. They are
currently referenced in:
	- vault.inventory (for defining inventory status in save files)
	- vault.dock (for verifying a hull exists in the catalogue before setting it as active)
	
	
---< Draw Objects >---
Most ships that only have a hull back + front and a sail just need the default draw object.

If a ship needs animated parts outside of those three parts, it create a new child of the
default draw object that has custom that inherits the create and step events of the default
drawer, but can otherwise do whatever needs to be done in draw.

Example: steamboat needs a spinning steam wheel, but can use the default draw methods.


---< Single vs Two-piece Sail >---
If a sail and mast must be a fixed piece together, the sail sprite will be one image together
in the sprite. If there are two frames in a sail sprite, the drawSail method will assume they
need to animated separately. (With wobble.)
