In the town:
	- I can speak to an NPC. This opens the store.
	- In the store, I can see the hulls with their accurate statuses
	- If a hull is purchasable, I can do so:
		- This will update the status to "active"
		- This will remove some ammount of coins from the vault
	- At the dock:
		- I can choose to sail with any hull I own
		- If the hull that is selected is unavailable, it will be cleared upon town start
		- Any hull that is selected will be shown at the dock floating

On the map:
	- If a hull is lost on a level, I will see an icon for that orb above the level
	
When sailing:
	- If a hull is lost on the map:
		- I will "collect" it if I reach that progress point
		- If I reach the end of the level, the orb will be recovered
	- If my ship is destroyed:
		- My current hull will be "lost at sea" at my current progress point
		- All collected lost hulls: returned to their place in the map
		- All uncollected lost hulls: destroyed
