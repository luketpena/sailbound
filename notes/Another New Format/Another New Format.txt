The game map generates in a line, with biomes generating along that line. The player gets to see one biome
ahead of themselves on the line. Events get evenly distributed along the line, with different biomes having
different possible events that can occur.

The path can split into up to three separate lines, but always rejoins.

Whenever a grid is crossed there is some kind of location or interaction that can take place between grids.
These once again depend on the biome.

Possible interactions:
 - A merchant selling items and upgrades
 - An alchemist who can temporarily enchant the boat
 - A lookout tower that can reveal biomes, events, and interactions along the path
 - Buried treasure for bonus gold and gems
 - A blacksmith that can repair, increase your max health, or add an additional upgrade slot
 - A teleport tower that lets you skip a few blocks ahead
 - A cursed chest that gives a temporary debuff for some kind of reward
 - Quest givers that give you challenge and a limit to how many blocks you must complete it in
 - A bookie that lets you wager money on a percent chance of making bonus cash or losing your wager
 - Empty ocean where nothing happens
 - A fortune teller that will let you choose what kind of block, location, or event they will reveal to you
 - A wind trickster-god that will blow you back a number of space
 - One seagull carries a great reward, one has an okay reward, two have nothing, one has a bomb. Pick the right seagull after they mix up
 - 

The player has two currencies:
 - Coins [purchase goods and items in a single playthrough - they do not carry over]
 - Gems [purchase goods back at port, such as hulls and other unlocks]
 
Every hull has a limited number of upgrade slots. The number varies from hull to hull. 
 - Upgrades provide some gameplay-altering bonus to the player
 - Upgrades come in varying quality: bronze, silver, gold, super
 - Any quality can be cursed. Cursed cannot be removed without damaging the hull
